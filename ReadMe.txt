This repository is used to train and test machine learning models

model_batch_training.py is used to train LSTM models
model_batch_training_GRU.py is used to train GRU models
model_batch_training_SVM.py is used to train SVM models

test_LSTM.py, test_GRU.py, test_SVM.py is used to test the machine learnig models

As is, the files require the same database as Lindum owns to get data and to store results.
Before training, scalers has to be created
